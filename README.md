Homework02_Program1 is a program that allows the user to move three seek bars changing the background color. Then the user can save the color to a list. 
Only issue I had was when running on a different computer the code did not like the use of "this" for example line 261 adapter = new ColorListAdapter(this, listOfColors); 
The "this" had an error, but after rewriting "this" it worked perfectly fine. 
Not entirly sure what the problem is/was
